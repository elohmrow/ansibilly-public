all you have to do is:
	./install_magnolia.sh
and it will:
	- download the most recent magnolia
	- download tomcat 
	- download the most recent author training light modules
	- set some magnolia.properties
	- use author-bootstraps-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar to do some bootstrapping:
		- change superuser password
		- disable common users
		- create new training user
		- add training license
	- put a magnoliaAuthor and a magnoliaPublic in tomcat's webapps
	- start tomcat => start magnolia
